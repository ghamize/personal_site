				Dr. Moska Hamidi was born in Kabul, Afghanistan. Due to the unstable political climate of Afghanistan at the time, Dr. Hamidi's parents moved the family to Ottawa, Canada, where she and her siblings grew up.

				As a result of Dr. Hamidi's tumultuous early childhood, and her parents' traumatic experience of having to leave behind their home, she values humanitarian causes. Dr. Hamidi has always been actively involved in volunteer efforts, and wishes to make this a focal point for the future.

				Dr. Hamidi is dedicated to her career, but believes strongly in cultivating personal interests beyond one's career. She has always been an avid traveller, a follower of politics, and a sports fan. She is also passionate about raising health awareness amongst non-medical professionals, and also raising awareness on issues pertaining to those who are within the medical world. Ultimately, Dr. Hamidi wants to make positive changes to the healthcare system, and wishes you to welcome her on that journey.
